These are personal notes so they do not encompass everything presented in this course. These notes only cover the items in the course I feel that I did not already know beforehand, or that made enough sense that I didnt feel It would be something I would forget/need to study later.

## Foundations of Cybersecurity
### Module 1

Remember to take breaks

Follow curiousity into learning , it doesnt need to be inside of the confines of this course

**Responibilites of an Entry Level Sec Analyst**
<li> Monitoring and protecing info and systems.
<li> Analysts are generally the first to respond to a threat being found.
<li> Searches for weaknesses within their own organization.
<li> Installing prevention software
<li> Conducting periodic security audits

**Sec Analysts should obtain the following skills**
<li> Programming Languages
<li> Security Info and Event Managment (SIEM) tools
<li> Computer Forensics

### Module 2

**Handeling a Security Breach**
<li> Keep your cool during a security breach
<li> People will be looking for you to be confident and calm 
<li> Stop the breach. Shut down the items that the breach is happening in

**The 8 CISSP Security Domains**
<li> Security and Risk Managment
    <ul>
        <li>focuses on defining security goals and objectives, risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity, and the law.</li>
    </ul>
<li> Asset Security
    <ul>
        <li>This domain focuses on securing digital and physical assets. It's also related to the storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of data.
    </ul>
<li> Security Architecture and Engineer
    <ul>
        <li>This domain focuses on optimizing data security by ensuring effective tools, systems, and processes are in place.
    </ul>
<li> Communications and Network Security
    <ul>
        <li>This domain focuses on managing and securing physical networks and wireless communications.
    </ul>
<li> Identity and Acces Managment
    <ul>
        <li>focuses on keeping data secure, by ensuring users follow established policies to control and manage physical assets, like office spaces, and logical assets, such as networks and applications.
    </ul>
<li> Security Assessment and Testing
    <ul>
        <li>This domain focuses on conducting security control testing, collecting and analyzing data, and conducting security audits to monitor for risks, threats, and vulnerabilities.
    </ul>
<li> Security Operations
    <ul>
        <li>This domain focuses on conducting investigations and implementing preventative measures.
    </ul>
<li> Software Development Security
    <ul>
        <li>This domain focuses on using secure coding practices, which are a set of recommended guidelines that are used to create secure applications and services.
    </ul>

### Module 3

**Security Frameworks**

Guidlines used for building plans to help mitigate risk and threats to data and privacy.

Purposes Include
<li> Protecting PII (Personally Identifiable Info)
<li> Securing financial information
<li> identifying security weaknesses
<li> managing organizational risks
<li> aligning security with business goals

The four core components of frameworks
<li> Identifying and documenting security goals
<li> Setting guidlines to achieve security goals
<li> Implementing security processes
<li> Monitoring and communicating results

**Security Controls**

Safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks

Something like tracking which employees have completed a security training

**CIA Triad**

A foundational model that helps inform how organizations consider risk when setting up systems and security policies
<ul>
    <li> Confidentiality
        <ul>
            <li> Only authorized users can access specific assets
        </ul>
    <li> Integrity
        <ul>
            <li> Data is Correct, Authentic, and Reliable
        </ul>
    <li> Availability
        <ul>
            <li> Data is accessable to those authorized to access it
        </ul>
</ul>

** NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**

A voluntary framework that consistes of standard, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk.

This is essentially a blueprint for people to follow if they so choose, sounds to me like this is to allow organizations to adopt a framework easily, maybe for smaller businesses that need something, but not something specific to follow.
