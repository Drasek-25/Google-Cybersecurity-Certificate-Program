<li> Conducting periodic security audits

**Sec Analysts should obtain the following skills**
<li> Programming Languages
<li> Security Info and Event Managment (SIEM) tools
<li> Computer Forensics

### Module 2

**Handeling a Security Breach**
<li> Keep your cool during a security breach
<li> People will be looking for you to be confident and calm 
<li> Stop the breach. Shut down the items that the breach is happening in

**The 8 CISSP Security Domains**
<li> Security and Risk Managment
    <ul>
        <li>focuses on defining security goals and objectives, risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity, and the law.</li>
    </ul>

    </ul>

### Module 3

**Security Frameworks**

Guidlines used for building plans to help mitigate risk and threats to data and privacy.

Purposes Include
<li> Protecting PII (Personally Identifiable Info)
<li> Securing financial information
<li> identifying security weaknesses
<li> managing organizational risks
<li> aligning security with business goals

The four core components of frameworks
<li> Identifying and documenting security goals
<li> Setting guidlines to achieve security goals
<li> Implementing security processes
<li> Monitoring and communicating results

**Security Controls**

Safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks

Something like tracking which employees have completed a security training

**CIA Triad**

A foundational model that helps inform how organizations consider risk when setting up systems and security policies
<ul>
    <li> Confidentiality
        <ul>
            <li> Only authorized users can access specific assets
        </ul>
    <li> Integrity

            <li> Data is accessable to those authorized to access it
        </ul>
</ul>

**NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**

A voluntary framework that consistes of standard, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk.

This is essentially a blueprint for people to follow if they so choose, sounds to me like this is to allow organizations to adopt a framework easily, maybe for smaller businesses that need something, but not something specific to follow.

### Module 4

**SIEM tools**

An application that collects and analyzes log data to monitor critical activites in an organization. I.E.. how the company wants to respond to events.

**Playbooks**

A manual that provides details about any operational action

**Network protocol analyzers**

I know this item by the name *Packet Sniffer* 

Is a tool designed to capture and alayze data traffic within a network.


**Professional statement**

## Play It Safe: Manage Security Risks

### Module 1

**IAM Identity Access Mgmt**
The components are Identification, Authentication, Authorization, Accountability 

**NISTS RMF Mgmt Framework**
<ul>
    <li> Prepare
        <ul>
            <li> Activites that are necessary to manage security and privacy risks before a breach occurs
        </ul>
    <li> Catagorize
        <ul>
            <li> Develop risk management processes and tasks. Security professionals then use those processes and develop tasks by thinking about how the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems and information can be impacted by risk
        </ul>
    <li> Select
        <ul>
            <li> To choose, customize, and capture documentation of the controls that protect an organization. Keeping a playbook up to date as an example
        </ul>
    <li> Implement
        <ul>
            <li> Implement security and privacy plans for the organization. Having good plans in place is essential for minimizing the impact of ongoing security risks
        </ul>
    <li> Assess
        <ul>
            <li> Determine if established controls are implemented correctly. An organization always wants to operate as efficiently as possible. So it's essential to take the time to analyze whether the implemented protocols, procedures, and controls that are in place are meeting organizational needs
        </ul>
    <li> Authorize
        <ul>
            <li> Being accountable for the security and privacy risks that may exist in an organization
        </ul>
    <li> Monitor
        <ul>
            <li> Monitor means to be aware of how systems are operating. Assessing and maintaining technical operations are tasks that analysts complete daily
        </ul>
</ul>

**Types of vulnerabilities**
<ul>
    <li> ProxyLogon
        <ul>
            <li>A pre-authenticated vulnerability that affects the Microsoft Exchange server. This means a threat actor can complete a user authentication process to deploy malicious code from a remote location.
        </ul>  
    <li> ZeroLogon
        <ul>
            <li> A vulnerability in Microsoft’s Netlogon authentication protocol. An authentication protocol is a way to verify a person's identity. Netlogon is a service that ensures a user’s identity before allowing access to a website's location.
        </ul>  
    <li> Log4Shell
        <ul>
            <li>Allows attackers to run Java code on someone else’s computer or leak sensitive information. It does this by enabling a remote attacker to take control of devices connected to the internet and run malicious code.
        </ul>  
    <li> PetitPotam
        <ul>
            <li> Affects Windows New Technology Local Area Network (LAN) Manager (NTLM). It is a theft technique that allows a LAN-based attacker to initiate an authentication request.
        </ul>  
    <li> Security logging and monitoring failures
        <ul>
            <li> Insufficient logging and monitoring capabilities that result in attackers exploiting vulnerabilities without the organization knowing it
        </ul>  
    <li> Server-side request forgery
        <ul>
            <li>Allows attackers to manipulate a server-side application into accessing and updating backend resources. It can also allow threat actors to steal data.
        </ul>  
</ul>       


**NISTS CSF Cyber Security Framework**
<ul>
    <li> Identify
        <ul>
            <li> The management of cybersecurity risk and its effect on an organization's people and assets.
        </ul>
    <li> Protect
        <ul>
            <li> The strategy used to protect an organization through the implementation of policies, procedures, training, and tools that help mitigate cybersecurity threats.
        </ul>
    <li> Detect 
        <ul>
            <li> Identifying potential security incidents and improving monitoring capabilities to increase the speed and efficiency of detections.
        </ul>
    <li> Respond
        <ul>
            <li> Making sure that the proper procedures are used to contain, neutralize, and analyze security incidents, and implement improvements to the security process.
        </ul>
    <li> Recover
        <ul>
            <li> Which is the process of returning affected systems back to normal operation.
        </ul>
</ul>


**OWASP Security Principles**
<ul>
    <li> Minimize attack surface area.
        <ul>
            <li> Attack surface refers to all the potential vulnerabilities a threat actor could exploit.
        </ul>
    <li> Principle of least privelege.
        <ul>
            <li> Users have the least amount of access required to perform their everyday tasks.
        </ul>
    <li> Defense in depth.
        <ul>
            <li> Organizations should have varying security controls that mitigate risks and threats.
        </ul>
    <li> Sepration of duties.
        <ul>
            <li> Critical actions should rely on multiple people, each of whom follow the principle of least privilege. 
        </ul>
    <li> Keep security simple.
        <ul>
            <li> Avoid unnecessarily complicated solutions. Complexity makes security difficult. 
        </ul>
    <li> Fix security issues correctly.
        <ul>
            <li> When security incidents occur, identify the root cause, contain the impact, identify vulnerabilities, and conduct tests to ensure that remediation is successful.
        </ul>
    <li> Establish secure defaults
        <ul>
            <li> The optimal security state of an application is also its default state for users; it should take extra work to make the application insecure. 
        </ul>
    <li> Fail securely
        <ul>
            <li> When a control fails or stops, it should do so by defaulting to its most secure option. For example, when a firewall fails it should simply close all connections and block all new ones, rather than start accepting everything.
        </ul>
    <li> Don’t trust services
        <ul>
            <li> Many organizations work with third-party partners. These outside partners often have different security policies than the organization does. And the organization shouldn’t explicitly trust that their partners’ systems are secure. 
        </ul>
    <li> Avoid security by obscurity
        <ul>
            <li> The security of an application should not rely on keeping the source code secret. Its security should rely upon many other factors, including reasonable password policies, defense in depth, business transaction limits, solid network architecture, and fraud and audit controls.
        </ul>
</ul>

**Common Elements of Internal Audits**
<ul>
    <li>Establishing the Scope and goals.
        <ul>
            <li> Scope refers to the specific criteria of an internal security audit
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li> Goals are an outline of the organizations security objectives
        </ul>
    <li>Conducting a risk assessment.
        <ul>
            <li> Goals are an outline of the organizations security objectives
        </ul>
    <li>Completing a controls assessment.
        <ul>
            <li> Closely reviewing an organization's existing assets, then evaluating potential risks to those assets, to ensure internal controls and processes are effective.
            <li> Control Catagories
            <ul>
                <li> Administrative Controls (Human controls)
                <li> Technical Controls (Hardware/Software)
                <li> Physical Controls (Gates/CCTV/Locks etc)
            </ul>
        </ul>
    <li>Assessing complaiance.
        <ul>
            <li> Determining whether or not the organization is adhering to necessary compliance regulations.
        </ul>
    <li>Communicating results.
        <ul>
            <li> Once the internal security audit is complete, results and recommendations need to be communicated to stakeholders. In general, this type of communication summarizes the scope and goals of the audit.
            <li> Stakeholder Communication
            <ul>
                <li>  Summarizes scope and goals of the audit.
                <li> Lists Existing Risks.
                <li> Notes how quickly those risks need to be addressed.
                <li> Identifies compliance regulations.
                <li> Provides reccomendation to improve sec posture.
            </ul>
        </ul>
</ul>

**Audit Questions**
<ul>
    <li> What is the audit meant to achieve?
    <li> Which assets are most at risk?
    <li> Are current controls sufficient to protect those assets?
    <li> What controls and compliance regulatyions need to be implemented
</ul>
